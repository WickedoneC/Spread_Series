# Spread_Series

<br/>

### Looking at the historical spread between the U.S. Corporate Bond Index Effective Yield and the U.S. 10 year treasury. 

<br/>

Given the historical 10 year U.S. treasury rate (going back to '96) and the yield on BAML's US Corporate Bond Index, what can we learn from the history of the spread between the two, and how can we model the spread for future periods?

<br/>

## EDA and Correlations

<br/>

Given the historical data, we can see that during the last two recessions (early 2000s, GFC), the sread spiked, displayed volatility, and then suddenly decreased. We can see that the GFC displayed a significantly higher spread, as expected.
